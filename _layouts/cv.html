    <p>Christian Grech is a highly skilled Machine Learning Engineer with a PhD in Information and Communications Technology and a Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering, achieving First Class Honors. He has a strong specialization in algorithms, data structures, modeling, and machine learning.</p>

    <p>Christian's coding skills include Python, C, Java, and R, while he also has expertise in MySQL, Elasticsearch, Pytorch, Pandas, AWS, Google Cloud, Logstash, Git, Docker, and Jupyter Notebook. He is certified as a Google Cloud Professional Data Engineer and Associate Cloud Engineer.</p>
      
    <p>Christian's professional experience includes working at Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY as a Postdoctoral Researcher, where he applied machine learning models for the virtual diagnostics of a free electron laser machine, utilized computer vision techniques to extract information from images, and created user-interfaces using PyQt to allow users to make use of machine learning models.</p>
      
    <p>He has also worked as a Freelance Data Scientist for Onest/Omni Iota, where he established Virtual Machines, SQL databases, Elasticsearch indices, and Streamlit GUIs for clients. He also implemented Natural Language Processing techniques on large datasets to extract useful data.</p>
      
    <p>Christian's previous position was as a Data Engineer at Gamesys Group, where he used Talend, Java, and AWS to create and manage data pipelines from various disparate sources. He worked closely with Data Scientists to deploy machine learning models and productionized a service that automatically publishes alerts based on Anti-Money Laundering rules.</p>
      
    <p>Prior to this, Christian worked as a Data and Instrumentation Engineer at the European Organization for Nuclear Research, CERN, where he developed software in MATLAB/Python and applied machine learning techniques. He also performed measurement on magnets for the Extra Low Energy Antiproton Ring. In addition, Christian worked as a Summer Student Intern at CERN, where he developed the new data acquisition framework using LabVIEW of the COLDEX (COLD bore EXperiment), which is an experiment that mimics a cryogenic vacuum system.</p>
      
    <p>Christian is proficient in English, Maltese, German, French, and Italian. He has been recognized with various awards, including the BOV Engineering Excellence Award, the Best Undergraduate Project Award by Bank of Valletta, the Best Electrical Engineering Project Award by the Chamber of Engineers, and the Best Student in Mathematics and Physics award by Sir M.A. Refalo Upper Secondary.</p>
