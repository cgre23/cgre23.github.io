On this page I will share some information about endeavours to share scientific knowledge with the public.

### 2020
* I won a student grant to present my work as part of the [International Particle Accelerator conference](https://www.ipac20.org/) (IPAC) 2020 held in Caen. The event was eventually cancelled due to the global pandemic.
* Presented my PhD work in the [Doctoral Symposium](https://www.um.edu.mt/newspoint/news/2020/03/2nd-annual-doc-school-symp?fbclid=IwAR298xhm4Oy0Xo2_lLsbudy3hLkQP_fRwuiXIWmn_q6kiDChNZyBkvT576I#.XnSTKGP9Pmc.facebook) organized by the University of Malta's Doctoral School.

### 2019
* Took part in a workshop: 'Communication training for experienced CERN guides', focused on improving science communication and public engagement skills. This course was given by [Malcom Love](http://www.malcolmlove.org/), who has worked for the BBC as a producer, hosted live radio shows, and delivered Famelab masterclasses around the world.

### 2016-2019
* As part of CERN's public outreach programme, I was trained as a guide and volunteering on a weekly basis to [guide tours at ten different visit points.](https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/university-science-students-visit-cern.674345)



### 2016
* Published an [article](https://www.um.edu.mt/library/oar/bitstream/123456789/19395/1/THINK%2c%202016-17%20-%20A9.pdf) in the University of Malta's [THINK Magazine](https://www.um.edu.mt/think/) on the use of muscle activity to control machines.
* I contributed to the organisation of the [TEDxCERN](https://www.ted.com/tedx/events/18826) event held at CERN, Geneva.

### 2015
*  As part of the [IEEE Malta student branch](https://www.facebook.com/ieeesbmalta/) I helped in the organization of events such as [Robot Wars](https://gadgetsmalta.com/features/robot-wars/), and volunteered in Malta's Science & Arts Festival, ['Science in the City'](https://scienceinthecity.org.mt/).
