**My recent activities**

* January 2024: Published my first blog post on a new open-source project I finished: [NLP Symptom Checker for Dutch speakers](https://christiangrech.medium.com/building-a-robust-dutch-nlp-symptom-checker-from-data-to-deployment-e389d874a247)

* October 2023: My team's efforts towards a hard X-ray self seeding mode for the European XFEL, to generate brighter X-ray flashes are now described in this  [publication in Nature Photonics](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41566-023-01305-x). The usage of the HXRSS device at the European XFEL already allowed taking groundbreaking steps toward a new generation of nuclear clocks based on the resonant excitation of the nuclear clock isomer 45Sc. <br>

* September 2023: My contribution to the success of the experiment carried out at European XFEL exploring the resonant X-ray excitation of the nuclear clock isomer 45Sc has been acknowledged, as the manuscript has been [published in Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06491-w). <br>

* June 2023: I presented a lecture on Machine Learning Performance Metrics at the Hochschule Darmstadt for 4th semester students. <br>

* April 2023: I was invited to talk about my work on using Computer Vision techniques for crystal calibration at the SPIE conference in Prague in April. <br>

**Who am I?**
<br>

<p align="justify">My primary research interests are machine learning, sensors and instrumentation. I have carried out my PhD within the University of Malta in collaboration with the European Nuclear Research Organization (CERN), where I was responsible for commissioning and calibrating a real-time magnetic measurement system (B-train) for a new synchrotron (ELENA) used in antimatter research, and using sensor data from this system, I constructed a machine learning model for predicting the magnetic field in the machine in real-time. I currently hold a Postdoctoral Researcher position with DESY, working on the application of machine learning algorithms for virtual diagnostics of the European XFEL. </p><br>

<p align="justify">With regards to my skills, my long-term experience of using numerical software packages (Matlab, R and Python) and machine learning platforms (Tensorflow, Keras, Pytorch, Numpy. Pandas) enables me to conduct empirical research effectively. </p>
