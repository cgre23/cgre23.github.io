**My recent activities**

* March 2023: my Predictive Maintenance Case Study using XGBoost Classifiers and lagged features is now [public](https://www.kaggle.com/code/antimattermatters/using-xgboost-to-predict-supply-downtime/). <br>

* February 2023: I have been invited to talk about my work on using Computer Vision techniques for crystal calibration at the SPIE conference in Prague in April. <br>

* January 2023: My work with my colleagues on hard x-ray self-seeding at the European XFEL has been accepted for publication by Nature Photonics. <br>

* June 2022: I presented my work on the application of Machine Learning techniques for the European XFEL in Bangkok, Thailand. <br>

* Sep 2021: My work on the development of a real-time magnetic measurement system at CERN was published by Electronics (MDPI).<br>


**Who am I?**
<br>

<p align="justify">My primary research interests are machine learning, sensors and instrumentation. I have carried out my PhD within the University of Malta in collaboration with the European Nuclear Research Organization (CERN), where I was responsible for commissioning and calibrating a real-time magnetic measurement system (B-train) for a new synchrotron (ELENA) used in antimatter research, and using sensor data from this system, I constructed a machine learning model for predicting the magnetic field in the machine in real-time. I currently hold a Postdoctoral Researcher position with DESY, working on the application of machine learning algorithms for virtual diagnostics of the European XFEL. </p><br>

<p align="justify">With regards to my skills, my long-term experience of using numerical software packages (Matlab, R and Python) and machine learning platforms (Tensorflow, Keras, Pytorch, Numpy. Pandas) enables me to conduct empirical research effectively. </p>
