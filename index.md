**Who am I?**
<br>

<p align="justify">My primary research interests are machine learning, sensors and instrumentation. I have recently defended my PhD within the University of Malta in collaboration with the European Nuclear Research Organization (CERN), where I was responsible for commissioning and calibrating a real-time magnetic measurement system (B-train) for a new synchrotron (ELENA) used in antimatter research, and using sensor data from this system, I constructed a machine learning model for predicting the magnetic field in the machine in real-time. Publications resulting from this research are listed in the Publications page. With regards to my skills, my long-term experience of using numerical software packages (Matlab, R and Python) and machine learning platforms (Tensorflow, Keras, Pytorch, Numpy. Pandas) enables me to conduct empirical research effectively. </p>
